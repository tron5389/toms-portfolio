While at that internship I was tasked with calculating the minimum and maximum capacities of each of our products that could be produced in any of our reactors. This process meant performing calculations by hand for over 300 products, while trying to figure out a way to perform these calculations faster using excel I accidentally stumbled upon VBA and this is where my coding journey began. I started by developing a workbook to store a hand made database of chemical properties that could be used by a built-in form to perform these calculations and store them in the workbook for the engineering team to view. It was during this process that I fell in love with application development and sought every opportunity thereafter to improve my skills. In the following summer I used my knowledge to help tutor my fellow classmates in using Matlab for our computer-aided engineering class and in my freetime I worked to re-create a desktop version of my first application to bring back to my internship where it could be installed on the network for anyone to use. It was during my last semester where I was assigned to implement and adminstrate an out-of-the-box CMMS software to facilitate and oversee our preventive maintenace and enviromental programs in their checmical plants. I had the chance to work closely with the vendors as both the champion of the product for MFG, as well as super user participating in customer feedback. Working with the team at Bigfoot maintenace really inspired me that pursuing a career in software developemnt was my true calling. When I returned to finish out my final semesters at school I wasted no time in trying to catch up on skills needed to work in software in addition to my coursework. For the last three semesters I tutored Management Information System courses in relational database design, and tutored my fellow engineers in process modeling with VBA and Matlab for our more advanced computational analysis and engineering courses. In addition to that I began working with a group of friends of mine who had founded a local business called MadMen software. At MadMen we worked with small local businesses to develop websites, and worked with aspiring start-ups in Alabama to develop web and mobile applications. I was hired as a Process Control Engineer at Andritz in Atlanta. Within a few weeks my managers found that I had a much more developed skillset with regards to software development and support, and I was assigned to be a Regional Support specialist for contracts in North America. To perform the process optimization services the Process Control Engineers on site used Metris, and IIoT software platform used for data analysis and managment of manufacturing plants, and this is what I was supportying. I traveled to customer sites to see their operations and work with them on strategies to implement Metris so the optomization work could begin. Back in the office I would support all of the contracts remotely in mass configuration of the application for start-up, general customer support, user reported bug resolution, and general maintenance of the platform. During this time period I had the chance to gain an expert knowledge of Microsoft SQL and SQL Server, as well as experience in overcoming the different challenges  faced when supporting customers directly. I also had the chance to develop many ad-hoc solutions for our customers that Metris could not serve. I worked with a major client to use their AWS Redshift data lake to become and enterprise source for providing hard to access 3rd party data to individual Metris servers on site. I worked with many customers on developing advanced reporting services on-top of their Metris servers using SSRS. I also started to gain experience in C# development during this time by creating a baselining application that would integrating with an existing Metris server. Because of this, I eventually began working with the development team as a QA analyst as well as a 2nd level support for consumers of the platform on the business side. I would assist customers when they reported errors that could not be fixed by level 1 support, and I would bring these issues back to the development team during sprint meetings and discuss ways to improve the Metris product to address the customers needs. Eventually I transitioned to being a full stack developer on the team full-time, and in this current role I have been able to realize alot of the improvements and customer needs that I was unable to address before. The most gratifying thing about this positon is seeing many years of work and experience come full circel, as I now get to do something about the issues and customer needs that I was not able to address in the past with my developments. I hope that this journey never ends, and I look forward to many years of continuous learning and development of amazing software applications for even more amazing end users!"}),Object(l.jsx)("br",{}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"When I'm not working or coding I really love doing any hands on activity.

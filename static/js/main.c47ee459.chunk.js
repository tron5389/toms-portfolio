I was attempting to create a spreadsheet for this when I accidentally stumbled upon VBA and creating this VBA forms project was my very first application. Building on this experience I spent time in the summer studying object oriented programming, and I rebuilt the previous application using VB.Net and SQL to install at my internship for all the engineers to use. The next term I served as the global admina nd head of implementation for a new CMMS software. Working with the software vendor while implementing and building more of my own application solidified my feelings that Software Development was the path for me. I spent the rest of my college career honing these skills in addition to completing my coursework. I tutured MIS courses in relational database design and worked with a few friends at a company we had called MadMen Software, where we assisted with local businesses and aspring start-ups in creating web and mobile applications. I was hired to Andritz after college as a Process Control Engineer, but soon after I started they realized my software skills were much more prominent and I began working with the Andritz Technology group. I began by travelling to site to work with customers implementing their IIoT platform for manufacturing plants called Metris. I supported customers remotely and on-site configuring and supporting the platform. Eventually I began working on a lot of ad-hoc development to provide custom reporting and data solutions using SQL, AWS Redshift, and C#. Later I started working more closely with the develoment team as an SME for several product groups as well, as well as participating with these product groups peforming QA and backlog refinement. In August 2020, I transitioned to the development team as a Full Stack developer to work on developing new features to meet key cutomer demands."})]})}),p=n(14),m=(n(34),function(){var e=Object(i.useState)(!1),t=Object(p.a)(e,2),n=t[0],r=t[1],s=Object(i.useState)(0),o=Object(p.a)(s,2),d=o[0],h=o[1],j=Object(c.f)(),m=function(){var e=window.innerWidth;h(e),e>600&&r(!0)},b=function(){d<600&&r(!1)};return Object(i.useEffect)((function(){return m(),window.addEventListener("resize",m),function(){return window.removeEventListener("resize",m)}}),[]),Object(l.jsx)("nav",{className:"navbar",children:Object(l.jsxs)("div",{className:"nav-wrapper",children:[Object(l.jsx)("div",{className:"logo",children:Object(l.jsx)(a.c,{to:"/",children:Object(l.jsx)("img",{src:"".concat("/toms-portfolio","/atom-solid.svg"),alt:"brand"})})}),Object(l.jsxs)("div",{className:"list-wrapper",children:[Object(l.jsx)("img",{src:"https://github.com/DwinaTech/public-images/blob/main/menu-bars.png?raw=true",alt:"Menu bars",style:{opacity:n?0:1},onClick:function(){r(!n)}}),Object(l.jsx)("img",{src:"https://github.com/DwinaTech/public-images/blob/main/cross-menu-icon.png?raw=true",alt:"Menu cross",style:{opacity:n?1:0},onClick:function(){r(!n)}}),Object(l.jsxs)("ul",{style:{left:n?"0":"-100vw"},children:[Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:Object(l.jsx)(a.c,{to:"/",onClick:b,style:{color:"/"===j.pathname&&"#4071f4"},children:"Home"})}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:Object(l.jsx)(a.c,{to:"/about",onClick:b,style:{color:"/about"===j.pathname&&"#4071f4"},children:"About"})}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:Object(l.jsx)(a.c,{to:"/skills",onClick:b,style:{color:"/skills"===j.pathname&&"#4071f4"},children:"Skills"})}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:Object(l.jsx)(a.c,{to:"/works",onClick:b,style:{color:"/works"===j.pathname&&"#4071f4"},children:"Works"})}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:Object(l.jsx)(a.c,{to:"/contact",onClick:b,style:{color:"/contact"===j.pathname&&"#4071f4"},children:"Contact"})})]})]})]})})}),b=(n(35),function(){return Object(l.jsxs)("div",{className:"skills",children:[Object(l.jsx)("h1",{children:"Skills"}),Object(l.jsxs)("div",{className:"content",children:[Object(l.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(l.jsx)("strong",{children:"Languages:"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"C#"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"SQL / T-SQL"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"VB.NET"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"VBA"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"CSS3"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"HTML5"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"JavaScript"})]}),Object(l.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(l.jsx)("strong",{children:"Libraries:"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"Selenium"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"HTML Agility Pack 5"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"Newtonsoft.json"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"Telerik .Net"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"React.js"})]}),Object(l.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(l.jsx)("strong",{children:"Tools:"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"Visual Studio"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"Visual Studio Code"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"Sql Server Management Studio"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"SonarQube / SonarLint"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"Postman"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"LINQPad"})]}),Object(l.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(l.jsx)("strong",{children:"ORM:"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"Enitity Framework Core"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:"Dapper"})]})]})]})}),u=(n(36),function(){return Object(l.jsxs)("div",{className:"works",children:[Object(l.jsx)("h1",{children:"Experiences"}),Object(l.jsx)("br",{}),Object(l.jsx)("h2",{children:"Andritz, Inc."}),Object(l.jsx)("h2",{children:"Software Development Engineer - Full Stack"}),Object(l.jsx)("h3",{children:"Date: August 2020 - Present"}),Object(l.jsx)("strong",{children:"Skills: C#, .NET Framework 4.8+, .NET Core, Fody, Entity Framework Core, Dapper, ASP.NET Core 3.1, REST API, Postman, Xamarin, MS SQL, Unit Testing, Backend Design, Front End Design, Git, WPF, IIOT, JIRA"}),Object(l.jsx)("h4",{children:"Front End:"}),Object(l.jsx)("li",{children:" Collaborate with key customers and product owners to design, create, and maintain features of the WPF application that is the primary UI client for the product.
